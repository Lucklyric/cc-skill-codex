Commands:
  exec        Run Codex non-interactively [aliases: e]
  login       Manage login
  logout      Remove stored authentication credentials
  mcp         [experimental] Run Codex as an MCP server and manage MCP servers

  cloud       [EXPERIMENTAL] Browse tasks from Codex Cloud and apply changes locally
  features    Inspect feature flags
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [PROMPT]
          Optional user prompt to start the session

Options:
  -c, --config <key=value>
          Override a configuration value that would otherwise be loaded from `~/.codex/config.toml`. Use a dotted path (`foo.bar.baz`) to override nested values. The `value` portion is parsed as JSON. If it fails to parse as JSON, the raw
          string is used as a literal.

          Examples: - `-c model="o3"` - `-c 'sandbox_permissions=["disk-full-read-access"]'` - `-c shell_environment_policy.inherit=all`

      --enable <FEATURE>
          Enable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=true`

      --disable <FEATURE>
          Disable a feature (repeatable). Equivalent to `-c features.<name>=false`

  -i, --image <FILE>...
          Optional image(s) to attach to the initial prompt

  -m, --model <MODEL>
          Model the agent should use

      --oss
          Convenience flag to select the local open source model provider. Equivalent to -c model_provider=oss; verifies a local Ollama server is running

  -p, --profile <CONFIG_PROFILE>
          Configuration profile from config.toml to specify default options

  -s, --sandbox <SANDBOX_MODE>
          Select the sandbox policy to use when executing model-generated shell commands

          [possible values: read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access]

  -a, --ask-for-approval <APPROVAL_POLICY>
          Configure when the model requires human approval before executing a command

          Possible values:
          - untrusted:  Only run "trusted" commands (e.g. ls, cat, sed) without asking for user approval. Will escalate to the user if the model proposes a command that is not in the "trusted" set
          - on-failure: Run all commands without asking for user approval. Only asks for approval if a command fails to execute, in which case it will escalate to the user to ask for un-sandboxed execution
          - on-request: The model decides when to ask the user for approval
          - never:      Never ask for user approval Execution failures are immediately returned to the model

      --full-auto
          Convenience alias for low-friction sandboxed automatic execution (-a on-failure, --sandbox workspace-write)

      --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
          Skip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed

  -C, --cd <DIR>
          Tell the agent to use the specified directory as its working root

      --search
          Enable web search (off by default). When enabled, the native Responses `web_search` tool is available to the model (no perâ€‘call approval)

      --add-dir <DIR>
          Additional directories that should be writable alongside the primary workspace

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
